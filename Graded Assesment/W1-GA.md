## Week 1 Graded Assessment

1. **Which of the following is not a drawback of file systems when compared to DBMS?**

**Explanation**: File systems are generally easier to set up initially compared to DBMS. However, they lack many features such as data integrity, security, and efficient data management, which are provided by DBMS.

2. **Which of the following creates and maintains the schema of a database?**

**Explanation**: DDL is a subset of SQL used to define and manage database schema. It includes commands like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP, which are used to create and modify the structure of database objects.

3. **Which of the following describes the concept that any change made to the physical schema should not affect the logical level of the DBMS?**

**Explanation**: Physical Data Independence refers to the ability to change the physical storage of data without affecting the logical schema. This means that changes in how data is stored do not impact how data is accessed and managed at the logical level.

4. **Which of the following components of DBMS interacts with the file manager of the operating system?**

**Explanation**: The Storage Manager is responsible for managing the storage of data on disk. It interacts with the file manager of the operating system to read and write data to the physical storage.

5. **Which of the following is not an example of DBMS?**

**Explanation**: Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet application, not a DBMS. DBMS examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle, which are designed to manage databases.

6. **Consider the given statements:**
   - DBMS provides an efficient platform for doing complex arithmetic computation on the data.
   - It is easier to create access rules in a file system than in a DBMS.
   - **Choose the correct option**: 

**Explanation**: DBMS is not primarily designed for complex arithmetic computations; it is designed for efficient data management. Creating access rules is generally easier in a DBMS due to built-in security features.

7. **Which type of SQL commands can lead to modification in the Data Dictionary?**

**Explanation**: DDL commands like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP modify the structure of database objects, which in turn updates the Data Dictionary that stores metadata about the database.

8. **Which component of DBMS maintains the consistency of a database when multiple transactions are executed simultaneously on the data?**

**Explanation**: The Concurrency Control Manager ensures that multiple transactions can occur simultaneously without leading to data inconsistency. It manages the isolation and synchronization of transactions.

9. **Storing multiple copies of the same data within the system is not advisable, because it increases:**

**Explanation**: Data Redundancy refers to the unnecessary duplication of data, which can lead to inconsistencies and increased storage costs. DBMS aims to minimize redundancy through normalization.

10. **Why do we use try-except blocks in Python programming language?**

**Explanation**: Try-except blocks are used to handle exceptions in Python. They allow the program to continue running even if an error occurs, by catching and managing the error gracefully.

I hope these explanations help! If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.
